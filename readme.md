# Deque implemented with DoublyLinkedRing

This package is trying to mimic some functionalities of Python's `deque` from [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque). Since there's already a [deques](https://nim-lang.org/docs/deques.html) implemented with `seq`, I had to call this `RingDeque`.

## Example Usage

Please take a look at [theTest.nim](tests/theTest.nim) for supported usage for now.
